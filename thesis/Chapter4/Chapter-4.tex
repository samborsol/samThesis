\chapter{Detecting Photoproduction in Ultra-Peripheral HI Collisions}

Central heavy-ion collisions produce large numbers of tracks compared to proton collisions. However, ultra-peripheral collisions are characterized by emptiness in most of CMS. As such, ultra-peripheral collisions can be thought of as the complement to the high multiplicity, hadronically dominated heavy-ion collisions. 

\section{Selection on Hadronic Forward Calorimeter}

	The operative variable for the HF is the maximum calorimeter-tower energy.

\section{Selection on Zero Degree Calorimeter}

	The zero degree calorimeter detects any neutrons emitted from the colliding nuclei. Neutron emission indicates that the nucleus dissociated, and that the interaction was not coherent. Removing these obviously incoherent events from our data sample improves our signal. 

\section{Selection on Pixel Tracker}

	High purity tracks are recorded by the pixel tracker. These tracks are then used to determine the size of rapidity gaps.
