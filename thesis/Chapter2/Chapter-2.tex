\chapter{Diffractive Dijet Photoproduction}

Diffractive dijet photoproduction is a powerful constraint on the relationship between next-to-leading order (NLO) and non-perturbative (NP) QCD.

\section{Diffraction in Photon-Hadron Collisions}

The DESY collaboration is responsible for measuring the structure functions of the proton via diffraction.

\subsection{Exclusivity}

UPC collisions are dominated by exclusive production modes. That is, the nuclei remain intact; therefore, CMS is mostly empty.

\section{Next to Leading Order QCD + NPDF}



\section{Perturbative QCD}

At low Bjorken-x, gluon interactions dominate the nucleus. As such, NLO-QCD no longer describes the PDF.
