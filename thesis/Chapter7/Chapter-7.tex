The Bjorken-x value of a parton is the fraction of the total nuclei's momentum carried by said parton. The scaling behavior of Bjorken-x proved that the constituents of the nucleus, the partons, are themselves pointlike.

\section{The Probe}

Ultra-peripheral collisions are charactered by photoproduction. The photon enters the nucleus and strikes a parton. The resulting dijet carries information about the elliptic gluon distribution in the angular correlation of the dijets.
