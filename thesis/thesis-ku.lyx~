\begin_layout Abstract
This is the Spring 2017 revision template.
 There have been some minor changes in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kuthesis.cls
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in response to requests from users over time.
 The changes have been relatively minor.
 The class file now allows students to list as many as 7 committee members,
 each with their own titles and roles.
 The size of the names of the chapters is now slightly reduced (from the
 LaTeX 
\family typewriter

\backslash
Huge
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter

\backslash
Large
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
How to use these files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Step 1.
 Study the features in this document.

\series default
 Please read through this Abstract.
 It is intended to be readable, pleasant, welcoming and helpful.
 The PDF you are reading was created by compiling thesis-ku.tex.
 After you finish inspecting this document, then look at the LaTeX document
 from which it came.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Step 2.
 Inspect the LaTeX source code that is provided in the same package as the
 PDF document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
There are some special features that will become apparent once you look
 at the LaTeX source code.
 The thesis-ku document is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document.
 The separate chapters are in separate folders.
 It is possible to work on one chapter at a time, and compile just that
 chapter, or it is possible to compile the whole thing by compiling the
 master document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In thesis-ku, we have included as many bells and whistles as possible so
 that users can see how the different features can be put to use.
 We have a BibTeX bibliography, graphs, equations, cross references, table
 of contents, and all of the other interesting features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The most recently inserted feature is support for hyperlinks in the PDF
 output.
 We checked with the KU Graduate Dean's office and they said there is no
 policy prohibiting the use of hyperlinks, but there is also no guarantee
 from the dissertation hosting institution that they will either work or
 not cause problems down the line.
 We believe there is not too much danger here, this feature is easy to turn
 off if need be.
 Also, it is not entirely clear what color the links must be inside the
 document, so we take a conservative step here of making the links black,
 so they appear as simple text.
 The default settings for the 
\family typewriter
hyperref
\family default
 package, which we have altered, caused ugly pink links with gross looking
 boxes around them.
 Users can change the link color to blue.
 It is fairly easy to see how this can be done in the document preamble.
 Look for something like this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
urlcolor={black},citecolor={black},allcolors={black}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 and think of Henry Ford's famous comment, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can have a car in any color you like, as long as its black.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Step 3.
 Try to compile the thesis-ku document!
\series default
 Before you try to edit this and enhance it (and put your name on it), please
 
\series bold
STOP
\series default
! Recompile this document exactly as it is.
 This will force you to test your LaTeX setup.
 Unzip the collection, consider installing the class file as described below,
 then try to compile 
\family typewriter
thesis-ku
\family default
.
 That zipped collection has everything in the right places, don't re-arrange
 directories yet.
 Until you reproduce the PDF you are reading now, you are not ready to start
 making changes.
 People often come forward with questions and our first question for them
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

did you compile (without error) 
\family typewriter
thesis-ku.tex
\family default
?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Until we hear those people say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we are generally unable to help with their revised documents.
 That's the only way we will know if your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 setup is ready to go.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\emph on
If you have used \SpecialChar LaTeX

\emph default
, you will find this more or less self explanatory.
 There's a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
thesis-ku.tex
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document, it links together the content of several files.
 Compile that with 
\family typewriter
\series bold
pdflatex
\family default
\series default
.
 The class file that makes this go, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is saved in the current working directory.
 It is not necessary to install it into your broader \SpecialChar LaTeX
 distribution, but
 you can if you like.
 One reason to install kuthesis.cls in your larger setup is to silence warnings
 from editors that don't remember to look in your current directory.
 If you install 
\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default
 in your system, you don't need to keep a copy of it with your dissertation.
 That may be convenient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\emph on
If you have never used \SpecialChar LaTeX

\emph default
, we will tell you how to compile this document.
 But, before you try, can we give you a warning:

please don't make writing your dissertation your first \SpecialChar LaTeX
 project

 Start with some simpler example documents.
 Write some letters to your loved ones, experiment a little bit.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The first user customization is to insert your name and the names of some
 committee members.

\begin_layout Abstract
Here you see the most important template updates for October, 2015.
 We have newly enhanced 
\family typewriter

\backslash
committee
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
role
\family default
 environments.
 Now, we allow users to specify up to 7 committee members and each one can
 have a different role.
 Why provide all of this luxury? There were unexpected requests from students.
 The original KU Thesis template had only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chair
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the first member.
 Users asked for a secondary title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Co-Chair
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for member 2.
 Then they wanted to change the title of the first member to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lead Chair
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then they wanted to add a the third Co-Chair, and so forth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Now we accommodate those requests by leaving blank spots for up to seven
 committee members and seven roles.
 It is vital for you to leave the blank place holders {} if you don't want
 to list additional members or roles.
 This example document shows some funny titles, we do that only to prove
 it is possible.
 Generally, there is only a Chair, possibly a Co-Chair.
 This example has more roles in this example for fun.
 Or to make fun of a professor.
 You can change them to {}, of course, if you don't want a named role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The other thing to change is the date section.
 Lower in the preamble, you should see a place to insert some dates.
 Originally, we told students 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just write those dates in by hand, like we did back in the olden days.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But they kept saying they wanted them type set, so here they are.
 If a date is currently unknown, just leave a blank inside the brackets

How to Configure your LaTeX Distribution with kuthesis.cls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
I wish we had packaged 
\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default
 into an official LaTeX distribution package so that it could be easily
 installed by your distribution.
 We did not do that, however, and so it is up to you to place a copy of
 
\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default
 in the right spot
\family typewriter
.

\family default
 This is not truly necessary.
 Programs like pdflatex will find 
\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default
 if you have it in the same directory as the document.
 I believe, with 97.5% confidence, it will find 
\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default
 if you keep it in the same directory as your document.
 If you want to use kuthesis.cls for several documents, it is necessary to
 install 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
kuthesis.cls
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file structure.
 That is generally an easy process, but it is different on every type of
 computer.

 an

 This installs just a small subset of MikTeX and pieces can be separately
 downloaded when needed.
 In Fall, 2016, we had some difficulties during a LaTeX workshop because
 the MikTeX package server was unavailable.
 As a result, we have been migrating away from MikTeX (and the LyX installer
 bundle) to use TeXLive for Windows (

 often complain that LyX seems to

 for the moment.
 Just click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Windows, there is a hidden AppData directory inside the user's home folder.
 How to find it? Run \SpecialChar LyX
.
 A window should appear with a row of pull down menus at the top.
 Choose Tools/Preferences.
 Change something trivial, then close the menu.
 That will force \SpecialChar LyX
 to create a user folder.
 Then search inside your user directory for a key word such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lyxrc.defaults
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Probably, searching for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*lyx*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be sufficient.
 In MS Windows 7, I found

 Caution: The AppData folder is hidden/concealed and, in order to find it
 in Windows Explorer, it is necessary to change the folder options to NOT
 hide protected files and folders.
 Windows 10 is very similar.

 Documentation for OS X El Capitan indicates that Apple has followed the

 Let LyX find your changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
\noindent
In LyX, find the pull down menu item Tools -> Reconfigure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
After that, LyX should work and not warn you about files it thinks it does
 not have.
 Once again, it is not necessary to do these reconfigurations, but LyX will
 not warn about missing pieces anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We notice that LyX is not, by default, configured to do spell-checking as
 you type.
 This is a vestigial setting, a reflection of the days long ago when people
 knew how to spell.
 To turn on the spell checker, use the pull down menu 
\family typewriter
Tools
\family default
 -> 
\family typewriter
Preferences
\family default
 -> 
\family typewriter
Language Settings
\family default

 One must choose a program to serve as the

Spellchecker engine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then click

Spellcheck Continously

 The Spellchecker engine I use in Ubuntu Linux is called Enchant.
 I expect you will find one in your operating system, or can find one.
 If not, we may have to ask Mr.

The truly bad part of using \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is that the errors and warnings are, generally,
 not understandable.
 They are not understandable to me and I've been using \SpecialChar LaTeX
 for about 20 years.
 I mean, well, they are simply too abstract.
 Too complicated.
 If you insert an illegal character, such as an

At best, the message will point to the line you inserted to cause the problem,
 but often the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 system cannot guess where your mistake is, it can only say
 something is wrong.
 The best way to defend yourself:

Don't make a lot of changes without trying to compile.
 It is easy to insert a feature that breaks the document.
 Compile often so you know when things have gone wrong.

Use a Version Management System!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If this is an important project, please consider installing Git or some
 other version management program.
 It is difficult to avoid clutter if you have to rename your file every
 day.
 I see user directories full of files named, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

my_diss.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

my_diss.2.lyx

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

my_diss_rejected.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and so forth.
 It is very difficult to keep old and new versions straight unless you use
 a version manager.
 A version manager will handle that for you.
 You will just have one file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

my_diss.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and you will have the ability to compare old and new snapshots.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
I urge you to keep your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 document in Git so you can make frequent commits
 and it will be easy to step back in time.
 This is one reason why you should work on separate chapters, so if you
 break something, then you are more likely to find your mistakes.

KU requires that fonts be compiled with the final result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The pdflatex compiler will insert fonts when it compiles the document.
 However, there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gotcha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If you create PDF documents separately, and you forget to embed the fonts
 with them, then the KU Graduate Dean's office is likely to reject your
 thesis.
 When a PDF is included within this document, pdflatex does not check to
 see if fonts are embedded in those PDFs.
 It assumes they are as you want them; fonts for those included files are
 not automatically inserted by pdflatex.
 When a graph, for example, is created in R and exported to PDF, it will
 not include the font encodings by default.
 It is possible to add those encodings.
 Little details like this come up from time to time and we make note of
 them in

 I think doing anything else is finger painting.
 I've watched 20 MA and PhD theses written with this template and I know
 a bright student will succeed and be happy with the result.
 If you have a laptop computer and you want to show me some errors, I can
 give you 5 or 10 minutes.
 But not much more...
