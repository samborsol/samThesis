\chapter{Monte Carlo Generation and Reconstruction}

The Monte Carlo (MC) for this analysis was generated using the RAPGAP software package. RAPGAP is a generator for eletron-proton MC. The structure functions measured at HERA are used to model a variety of diffractive processes. Each event has a characteristic energy for the virtual photon exchanged by the electron and proton. This photon energy is used to reweigh the MC to model the energy distribution of the Weizacker Williams photon flux.
