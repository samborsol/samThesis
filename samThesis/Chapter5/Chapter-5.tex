\section{H1}

The H1 Collaboration is an experiment hosted by the HERA electron-proton collider at DESY in Hamburg, Germany. 

\subsection{Diffractive Jets in ep}

Diffractive jet analyses at H1 demonstrate factorization breaking in the nuclear parton distribution. In comparison to H1 data, next-to-leading order QCD calculations of the diffractive-photoproduction dijet cross-section are a factor of two larger than measured. 

\section{RAPGAP}

RAPGAP is a Monte Carlo generator created for H1 analyses, specifically diffractive studies. By default, RAPGAP models electron-proton and proton-proton collisions. However, ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions are distinct from electron-proton collisions only in the photon spectrum. Re-weighing RAPGAP events by the heavy-ion photon spectrum can thus model heavy-ion UPC.
